slack bot to display bitcoin value at current time

### Description
This simple bot returns the current value of Bitcoin in euros & dollars when called with the command **!bitcoin** in the general channel of our EBM project team slack.
It was part of an assignment to teach us how to work with NodeJS. I decided to push it a bit further and deploy it on Heroku to have it available at all time.

Feel free to use it for you own purposes (Could be replaced by a call to any other API !).
